const FAQ = [
  ["Why per company and not per seat?", "A tool for raising things fails the moment you count who is allowed to raise them. Everyone raises; the price does not change when you add people."],
  ["What exactly is a pilot?", "Five working days in one department, timing one recurring decision type - approve a tool, sign off a clause, answer a data request. Real requests, real owners. At the end you see the median time to first answer and where the waiting went. It is free; we ask for thirty minutes of feedback."],
  ["Do you need access to our systems?", "No. Cases are raised in one field on the site. Optionally, an employee forwards a single e-mail thread to one address - consent is the act of forwarding. There is no mailbox connection and no monitoring."],
  ["We have a works council. Is this a problem?", `Usually not, and we would rather have the conversation early. ${SITE.name} leads with problems and blockers, not an ideas scheme, and it records no per-person metrics. We can provide a written description of what is measured for the works council before the pilot starts.`],
  ["Where is our data stored?", "On servers in the EU. The privacy policy names the hosting provider. Your data is keyed to your company and never visible to another tenant."],
